# WHAT I LEARNT ABOUT GO STRUCT

* I learnt that a struct is a short for structure and it is used to create collection of members of different data types, into a single variable.

* While arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type into a single variable, structs are used to store multiple values of different data types into a single variable.

* A struct can be useful for grouping data together to create records. 
* To declare a structure in Go, use the type and struct keywords.

## Access Struct Members

To access any member of a structure, use the dot operator (.) between the structure variable name and the structure member:
Example
package main
import ("fmt")

type Person struct {
  name string
  age int
  job string
  salary int
}

func main() {
  var pers1 Person
  var pers2 Person

  // Pers1 specification
  pers1.name = "Hege"
  pers1.age = 45
  pers1.job = "Teacher"
  pers1.salary = 6000

  // Pers2 specification
  pers2.name = "Cecilie"
  pers2.age = 24
  pers2.job = "Marketing"
  pers2.salary = 4500

  // Access and print Pers1 info
  fmt.Println("Name: ", pers1.name)
  fmt.Println("Age: ", pers1.age)
  fmt.Println("Job: ", pers1.job)
  fmt.Println("Salary: ", pers1.salary)

  // Access and print Pers2 info
  fmt.Println("Name: ", pers2.name)
  fmt.Println("Age: ", pers2.age)
  fmt.Println("Job: ", pers2.job)
  fmt.Println("Salary: ", pers2.salary)
}
